# OSU Craft Center Online Tool

## Description of Our Project:
This web application automates the membership and class registration processes for the OSU Craft Center. 

The OSU Craft Center is located in the Student Experience Center. The Craft Center provides people with the opportunity and environment to learn art, be creative, 
and use art materials and machinery that are available. Although the Craft Center is part of the university, the services are open to fee-paying and non-fee-paying 
OSU students, faculty and staff, OSU affiliates, and the general public. The Craft Center allows people to do many different types of art, such as ceramics, 
woodworking, paper art, jewelry, and photography. 

Currently, the Craft Center does all of its tasks and processes on paper. This results in problems and the need for staff to always be around at the front desk to 
help people who want to take advantage of the art resources. This has not been an efficient way to complete the tasks. For instance, the Craft Center requires 
paperwork for membership registration, locker rentals, class registration, and class orientations. Many times, the paperwork needs to be updated, which adds an 
extra manual step. All of this takes too much time and requires labor that can be automated.

The purpose of this web application is to make it easier for OSU students to take advantage of the Craft Center resources without having to go to the physical 
location to register for membership and courses. A student can register from the comfort of their dorm room, on their way to class, or wherever they choose. Also, 
this web application allows the administrators to manage existing memberships and edit the course catalog with ease. This will change the efficiency of the Craft 
Center for both students and employees of the Craft Center. This new tool for the Craft Center will be familiar to every user, as the user interface and features 
are similar to what is used today when registering for Facebook, managing online accounts, or signing up for classes online, right here at OSU. With a couple 
clicks of a button, students have access to all the creativity they could want from their college campus.
